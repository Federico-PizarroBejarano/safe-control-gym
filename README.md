# [COMING SOON]

Physics-based CartPole and Quadrotor [Gym](https://gym.openai.com) environments (using [PyBullet](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/)) with symbolic *a priori* dynamics (using [CasADi](https://web.casadi.org)) for **learning-based control**, and model-free and model-based **reinforcement learning** (RL). 

These environments include (and evaluate) symbolic safety constraints and implement input, parameter, and dynamics disturbances to test the robustness and generalizability of control approaches.
